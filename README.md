# Python for Field Calculations

## Data Downloads
You can download this whole repository from the [Releases](https://github.com/nickrsan/Python-GIS-Field-Calculations/releases) tab, but it won't include the true data. For that, you'll need to download the following:

* ArcGIS (10.x): https://github.com/nickrsan/Python-GIS-Field-Calculations/raw/master/arcgis/field_calculator_2019.mpk (open this wherever you like)
* QGIS (3.x): https://github.com/nickrsan/Python-GIS-Field-Calculations/raw/master/qgis/field_calculator.gpkg (put this in the QGIS subfolder of the downloaded repository). The `.qgz` map file is from QGIS 3.4, but the data will work in any QGIS version that supports GeoPackages.
